# Genetic-Path-Planner

Genetic algorithm solution for minimizing the distance traveled by N trucks (default 2) to P different homes (default 45).

# Running
Running the algorithm will automatically create a log file in `./data`

1. Navigate to `./src` directory via terminal
2. Update values of `crossover_probability`, `num_chromosomes`, etc at the very bottom in main()
3. Run `python3 Genetic_Path_Planner.py` (assumes you have python3 in your PATH. Otherwise use the full python3 binary path)
4. (Optional) Navigate to `./scripting` directory
              Run `python3 plot.py`
6. Navigate to `./data`
